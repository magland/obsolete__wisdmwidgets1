The purpose of this license is to to minimize restrictions on how collaborators,
scientists and developers may use this code, while at the same time preventing a 
competing commercial project from using it. I am open to suggestions on how to 
improve this license to achieve those aims.

I also request that you acknowledge the WISDM project if you use this code.
